PHASE 3 CHANGES
================================

1.	Corrected spelling mistakes and other typos in the test files

2.	Added test files for the new test cases such as "quit" and 
	buy transaction where the event and seller username are correct
	but seller is not selling tickets to the event...

3.	Every applicable test case needed to have the following added

	+ Current user accounts file read successfully.
	+ Available tickets file read successfully.

	and at the end

	>

4a.	Had to add a custom get_input method which is almost identical to the built-in
	getline function except that it looks ahead in the buffer and throws an EOF_INPUT
	exception which is caught before the program is terminated by the parent shell.

	This results in the front end producing output that matches our initially intended
	test case output files.


4b.	Had to correct the contents of our output files for each test case to match
	the actual output for the program due to the fact that redirecting the files
	as input results in the program terminating

	--> We cannot log prompts for data to the output file as we had expected, instead
		due to the < redirection the shell terminates once EOF of input has been reached

5.	Had test cases which had incorrect cua, dtf, atf files that were accidentally
	copied and renamed.

6.	Had to make corrections to the create test cases, where necessary input instructions
	(logout), which are needed in order for the daily transaction file to be created
	had been left out

7.	Corrected output files to match the exception messages in front end which were worded
	differently or modified in the front end. Such as having two similarly worded error
	messages combined into one error message, or error messages that were re-worded

	--> For example delete_2.out, now the message just says "User deleted successfully." 

8.	Had to correct test cases which were accidentally copied, (ie. delete_5.inp) which was
	copied from delete_4.inp (deleting yourself test case) and obviously broke the test case


9.	ACTUAL BUGS IN FRONT END FOUND, test cases sell_11 and sell_21 found actual bugs in the front
	end based on the requirements, there was no error checking for dollar input to verify that
	it contained decimal (e.g. 10 would not cause an error, when it really needed to be 10.00)

	Sell_21 caught a bug in the front end where I had forgot to add support for one sell transaction
	per session.

	--> Both of these required updating the front end source code.	

10.	Added a new test case, sell_22 which verifies that tickets can be sold over multiple new sessions.

11.	Test case refund_12 revealed a bug in the software, the actual limit for the test case is
	999,999.99 not $1000.00, the front end had to be updated to correct the issue and display
	a new error message. As well the test case output for refund_12 had to be corrected.

11.	 Had to update the test case dependencies for many of the buy
	 test cases due to the fact that irrelevant (backend-specific)
	 tests were removed.

	 --> Added a new test case, buy_17_1, (buy 17.1)
