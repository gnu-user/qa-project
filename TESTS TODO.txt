TESTS TODO
=======================


Need to add test case for the new error message when a title and seller are both valid
but there is no title AND seller found that matches.

	--> Tickets not found, specified seller is not selling tickets to that event.


Added additional error message, update tests:

	invalid title name, too short?
    	Invalid event title.



Deleting any outstanding tickets after a user has been deleted....
	--> Not sure how to implement this....
	--> Not sure how to handle the user in memory after they've been deleted...
		that is stateful... should be the backend's job...

FOR ADDCREDIT TRANSACTION, JUST USING THE MESSAGE
"Credit added successfully." IF IT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
