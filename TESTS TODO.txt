TESTS TODO
=======================


Need to add test case for the new error message when a title and seller are both valid
but there is no title AND seller found that matches.

	--> Tickets not found, specified seller is not selling tickets to that event.



Changed the "can not" in delete self error message to the following:
deleting yourself:
    Invalid transaction, you cannot delete yourself.

    --> MUST GO AND FIX TESTS TO USE NEW ERROR MSG.




Added additional error message, update tests:

	invalid title name, too short?
    	Invalid event title.




Additional exception for generic invalid dollars amount, update tests
there is no specific message for credit/price they are 1 error message now:

    {INVALID_SALE_PRICE, "Invalid sale price, amount must be in dollars (e.g. 10.00)."},
    {INVALID_CREDIT_AMOUNT, "Invalid credit value, amount must be in dollars (e.g. 10.00)."},

    	--> INVALID_AMOUNT, "Invalid value, amount must be in dollars (e.g. 10.00)."

    {SALE_PRICE_NEGATIVE, "Invalid sale price, amount cannot be less than 0.00."},
    {CREDIT_AMOUNT_NEGATIVE, "Invalid credit value, amount cannot be less than 0.00."},

    	--> NEGATIVE_AMOUNT, "Invalid value, amount cannot be less than 0.00."




Deleting any outstanding tickets after a user has been deleted....
	--> Not sure how to implement this....
	--> Not sure how to handle the user in memory after they've been deleted...
		that is stateful... should be the backend's job...




Added new error message if seller username provided not found, update tests!

"Invalid seller username, seller is not selling any tickets."




Added a generic invalid transaction message, update the tests if needed:

generic invalid transaction, when logged in:
    Invalid transaction.




FOR ADDCREDIT TRANSACTION, JUST USING THE MESSAGE
"Credit added successfully." IF IT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
