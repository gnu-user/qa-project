TESTS TODO
=======================

1.	Add logout test suite dependency to ANY test suites that have test cases which
	involve creating a daily transaction file, as the DTF is created on logout. This
	pretty much involves every single test suite (create, buy, sell, refund, etc...)

	Add a brief section to the description about logging out and verifying that the
	transaction has been saved to the daily transaction file.

	--> example: delete_5 involves logging to the daily transaction file a user that
		was deleted

	--> sell_20 write to DTF

	--> refund_13 write to DTF



Added additional error message, update tests:

	invalid title name, too short?
    	Invalid event title.
